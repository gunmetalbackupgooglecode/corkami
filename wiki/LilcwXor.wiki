= introduction =
this crackme just requires a correct password...

at first I found it a bit uninteresting but hoped that the author would notmake something just impossible.

While having fun with it, I tried it to avoid any bruteforcing...

hoping that the logic would be enough.


the binary is in clean code, nothing obfuscated.

I like the use of CALL to push strings adress :)
= start =
it turns out that the serial is just used directly to xor a code buffer.

the same thing in pseudocode:
{{{
h = 0
l = start
    if h == 0
        b = name
        h = *b
    *l++ ^= h
    h = *++b
}}}

if the decrypted code fails when running, it will trigger an exception that shows that the serial is wrong.

Bad guy exception:

there is no other test on the serial.

the code is blindly decrypted, and executed.

execution will determine the rest.

here is the encrypted code buffer
{{{

}}}

the exception code just displays a message box and exits.

it doesn't act like a common EH.

we can only assume that the "bad guy" exception is similar to the "good guy" exception.

so we can build a skeleton of the correctly decrypted code:
{{{
6A ??
E8 ?? 00 00 00
[0-9a-zA-Z ]* 00
E8 ?? 00 00 00
[0-9a-zA-Z ]* 00
6A 00
E8 ?? 00 00 00 => 40139A (USER32.MessageBoxA)
6A 00
E8 ?? 00 00 00 => 401334 (KERNEL32.ExitProcess)
00000000
}}}
the decrypted code is near the imports so the calls are just one non-zero byte.

we assume that the entered serial is limited to pure alphanums chars.

in the decrypted buffer, we see that dyw (8A62647977) repeats itself 3 times.

the xor algo is using the serial as a circular buffer.

the difference between 3 repeated patterns is always 18 (0x12),

so we assume that's the length of the serial
{{{
04 7F8A62647977 1E5C5C551E55425B5E0047
5E 6F8A47647977 1D0409451B0415020D101C
0B 161500161D57 001F5645150A1C0C1C5103

04 6F8A65647977
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
     pattern
}}}

so let's represent the decrypted buffer in pieces of 18.
{{{
    è b d y w   \ \ U   U B [ ^   G  ^ o è G d y w       E                            W     V E           Q      0   0       6     e   e Ü   n 0 w    o è e d y w
047F8A626479771E5C5C551E55425B5E0047 5E6F8A476479771D0409451B0415020D101C 0B161500161D57001F5645150A1C0C1C5103 1D301730031603360518651C659A1C6E3077 046F8A65647977
}}}

and the code we expect. split in 3 because we don't know the length of strings.
{{{
6A??E8??000000
                                      00E8??000000                         
                                                          006A00E8??0000006A00E8??00000000000000
 n ? b ? d y w 
size : 0x48
}}}
so the known bytes give us immediately n?b?dyw to get a correct push call.

we don't know the style of the message box so the push is unknown.
so

I'll fill the 012345678901234567 string with the letters i know.

let's try with n1b3dyw78901234567...

of course because of the patterns it generates 3 calls (we assume we need 4)
because the first two are close, we assume they are the string ones.

and the last one is near the end of the buffer so we can only assume it's the exitprocess one.

to have a call to exitprocess we need a call to +A
{{{
$-5      >  E8 56000000     CALL    crackme.00401380
$ ==>    >  3C 3C           CMP     AL, 3C
$+2      >  3C 3C           CMP     AL, 3C
$+4      >- FF25 9C304000   JMP     DWORD PTR [<&KERNEL32.GlobalAllo>; kernel32.GlobalAlloc
$+A      >- FF25 A0304000   JMP     DWORD PTR [<&KERNEL32.ExitProces>; kernel32.ExitProcess
}}}
we want this call to match the exit process, the right caracter for that is o. => n1bodyw78901234567

and before all calls, we have a 00 character in our badguy exception. (end of strings, and 0 argument for messagebox &exitprocess)

so we need our pre-call character to decrypt as 00 in the last call, so so o => nobodyw78901234567

it also generates a push 0x10 like in the badguy start, and we have the 2 calls linked as well as the correct exitprocess,
and 00 before each call, so my assumptions were correct.

hopefully Lilcw was nice (or well his challenge would be just impossible and not interesting...

well now we have nobodyw... nobody will ? want ? won't ? would...

with nobodywill01234567 the buffer suddenly becomes very clear... can't be bad news.

same w000000ps as the badguy exception ? pass/keyword ? u_got_it ?

when trying to get the w0000ps, the following password is needed.

nobodywille.%1kn0w

it's not exact but close then

ever know ? even known ? something else ?

nobodywilleverkn0w just works....

the magic keyword is: congrats_u_got_it

Thanks for the entertaining challenge.
